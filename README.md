# COGS220Project

This web application was created as a project for COGS 220 in Fall 2018 (professor: [Jim Hollan](http://hci.ucsd.edu/hollan/)).

It uses [EventDrops](https://marmelab.com/EventDrops/) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to display two timelines simultaneously, in a synchronized manner (so that interactions that alter the timescale in one EventDrops chart are applied to the other EventDrops chart).

The code was based on Mike Bostock's EventDrops example for Observable
(link [here](https://beta.observablehq.com/@mbostock/hello-eventdrops)) and the
EventDrops demo's tooltip functionality (link [here](https://github.com/marmelab/EventDrops/tree/fc0d8ca4001156ddfc5738133b53bf479ffb190f/demo)).
